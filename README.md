# Plant-Disease-Detection
## Overview 
The main goal of this project is to build various machine learning models capable of detecting plant diseases using the PlantVillage Dataset. The models will classify images into two groups: the plants affected by diseases and the healthy plants. The project will be implemented using Google Colab. 
## Dataset
- Name: PlantVillage Dataset
- Source: Publiccly available dataset.
- Categories: Bell Pepper with bacterial spot, healthy Bell Pepper
